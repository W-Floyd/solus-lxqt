This is an exercise in packaging LXQt.
It is not ready - nor intended - for actual use, and it *will not* go into the Solus repos.

***

I don't really ever use LXQt, so I'm not the best person to be doing this.

#### Known issues
* LXQt panel segfaults when attempting to search while icons are broken
* icons are broken in file managers and panel until you toggle things around a bit in settings?
* hidpi sucks, and I don't want to break anything on my install just to test things right now

TODO: Strip deps back and readd as I rebuild - as is, there are probably extras that are not used.
